<p>Rather than asking for gifts we'd be delighted if you could contribute some of your time on the day instead.</p>

<p>As you may know weddings involve a lot of stuff happening at different times. We haven’t hired staff or a wedding planner either and we can't do it all by ourselves. We would really like your help to make the day go off with a bang.</p> 

<p>It might be something small like fetching drinks from the fridge at the right time or directing people where to park on arrival, rounding people up for the start of the ceremony or announcing the start of the disco. If you would like to be involved please let us know and we will assign you a job for the day. We have at least 50 different jobs identified so we would really appreciate the help. </p>

<p>If on the other hand you're determined to exchange money for goods we've put together a list of things we think might come in useful. We will be taking our camper van down to the tip of Cornwall so we can visit the Isles of Scilly after the wedding. Here is a list of luxury camping items we can use on our Honeymoon.</p>
