	<h2>Details</h2>
	<p>Adam and Mairead would like to invite you to take tea on the lawn on the weekend of May 16th 2014 to celebrate their marriage. The ceremony will take place at <a href="http://www.stowfordmanorfarm.co.uk/index.php">Stowford Manor Farm</a> in Wiltshire on Saturday 17th May at 1.30pm but we are planning to stay for the whole weekend.</p>

	<h2>The venue</h2>
	<p>Free camping accommodation will be available both Friday and Saturday night at Stowford Manor. The campsite has electricity points for live-in vehicles.</p>

	<p>The venue has a central courtyard with a shower block, toilets and washing up facilities to one side and a covered Barn to the other side providing a solid roof in the event of rain.</p>

	<p>Behind the Bed and Breakfast rooms is a lawn and patio where we will be holding the ceremony. The river Frome runs through the lawn. If you’re bringing small children please be aware there is open water here.</p> 

	<p>We will be erecting a small Marquee with a tea urn and solid flooring in the camping field to provide more shelter against the British weather. There will be proper seating for 100 people as well as hay bales for the other 50 guests.</p>

	<h2>Dress code</h2>
	<p>Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. </p>

	<p>If the thought of costume fills you with dread please don’t overly concern yourself. We are far more interested in the pleasure of your company than the clothes on your back. You might want to make a nod to the concept, perhaps a blue handkerchief in your pocket or a flower in your hair. </p>

	<p>If on the other hand you delight in the ridiculous we would ask you to fully embrace this. Don’t hold back, we aren’t planning to. We will be judging you as we see fit and awarding a gift to the best dressed individual. No pressure.</p>
