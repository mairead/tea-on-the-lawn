<h2>Nearby hotels, pubs and restaurants</h2>
<p>The Old Manor hotel - You might find the rooms a little random but the Interior is lovely and so are the owners.</p>

Wooley grange - We thought this place was over-priced corporate blandsville. We're not even going to give you the URL, that's how much we dislike it. 

<h2>B&Bs</h2>
<p>Home farm - stay here at your peril. It's super close but it's like an episode of the League of Gentlemen</p>

<h2>Pubs with accommodation</h2>
<p>The Hungerford Arms - The owners don't seem really with it. The food is pretty ropey. Attempts to reserve the rooms here have been met with confusion.</p>

<p>The tollgate Inn - We haven't stayed here but the menu looked good and its in Bradford on Avon proper, which is kind of classy so we are assuming this might be nice.</p>

<h2>Glamping options</h2>
<p>For those of you who don't want to rough it on the open ground but not flush enough to own your own vehicle we found a couple of posh camping options which sounded promising</p>

<p>bell tents trailers etc
