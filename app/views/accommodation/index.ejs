	<h2>Stowford manor</h2>
	<p>Unfortunately the B&amp;B rooms on site are already reserved for our families. However Bradford on Avon is tourist heaven and there are tons of options if you don't want to camp. We picked out a few to sample and here is our best advice. </p>

<div class="content-section">
	<h2>Hotels</h2>
	<p>The Old Manor hotel - You might find the rooms a little random but the interior is lovely and so are the owners.</p>
	<p>Wooley grange - We thought this place was over-priced corporate blandsville. We're not even going to give you the URL, that's how much we dislike it. </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
	<h2>B&amp;Bs</h2>
	<p>Home farm - stay here at your peril. It's super close to the wedding site but it's like an episode of the League of Gentlemen</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
	<h2>Pubs with accommodation</h2>
	<p>The Hungerford Arms - The owners don't seem really with it. The food is pretty ropey. Attempts to reserve the rooms here have been met with much confusion. You have been warned</p>
	<p>The tollgate Inn - We haven't stayed here but the menu looked good and its in Bradford on Avon proper, which is kind of classy so we are assuming this will be nice.</p>

	<h2>Glamping options</h2>
	<p>For those of you who don't want to rough it on the open ground but aren't flush enough to own your own vehicle we found a couple of posh camping options which sounded promising</p>
	<p>bell tents trailers etc</p>
