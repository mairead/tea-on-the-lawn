	<h2>Stowford manor</h2>
	<p>Unfortunately the B&amp;B rooms on site are already reserved for family. However Bradford-on-Avon is tourist heaven and there are tons of options if you don't want to camp. We picked out a few to sample and here is our best advice. </p>

<div class="content-section">
	<h2>Hotels</h2>
	<p>The Old Manor hotel - You might find the rooms a little random but the interior is lovely and so are the owners.</p>
	<p>Wooley grange - We thought this place was over-priced corporate blandsville. We're not even going to give you the URL, that's how much we dislike it. </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
	<h2>B&amp;Bs</h2>
	<p>Home farm - stay here at your peril. It's super close to the wedding site but it's like an episode of the League of Gentlemen</p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
	<h2>Pubs with accommodation</h2>
	<p>The Hungerford Arms - The owners don't seem really with it. The food is pretty ropey. Attempts to reserve the rooms here have been met with much confusion. You have been warned</p>
	<p>The tollgate Inn - We haven't stayed here but the menu looked good and its in Bradford-on-Avon proper, which is kind of classy so we are assuming this will be nice.</p>

	<h2>Glamping options</h2>
	<p>For those of you who don't want to rough it on the open ground but aren't flush enough to own your own vehicle we found a couple of posh camping options which sounded promising</p>
	<p>bell tents trailers etc</p>
